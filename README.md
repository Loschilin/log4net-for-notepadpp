TL;DR
### How do you get it ###
**Simple way**: If you have never defined of modified a User defined Language, you can simply download the file at [src/userDefineLang.xml](src/userDefineLang.xml) and override your existent in %APPDATA%\Notepad++ (Make sure you backup your file first)
**"Harder way"**: if you have modified or added a user defined language, you probably know what to do but anyways, download the file (same from above) open it in your favorite text editor ;) and copy the UserLang tag with its content and paste it to your current userDefineLang.xml file.

Enjoy!
